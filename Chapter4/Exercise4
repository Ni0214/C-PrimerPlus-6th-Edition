// chapter4exercise4.cpp : Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then last
//name, and that then constructs, stores, and displays a third string, consisting of the
//user’s last name followed by a comma, a space, and first name.Use char arrays and
//functions from the string header file.A sample run could look like this:
//Enter your first name : Flip
//Enter your last name : Fleming
//Here’s the information in a single string : Fleming, Flip
//

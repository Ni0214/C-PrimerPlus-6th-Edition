// chapter4exercise5.cpp : The CandyBar structure contains three members.The first member holds the brand
//name of a candy bar.The second member holds the weight(which may have a fractional
	//part) of the candy bar, and the third member holds the number of calories
	//(an integer value) in the candy bar.Write a program that declares such a structure
	//and creates a CandyBar variable called snack, initializing its members to "Mocha
	//Munch", 2.3, and 350, respectively.The initialization should be part of the declaration
	//for snack.Finally, the program should display the contents of the snack variable.

/ chapter4exercise9.cpp :  Do Programming Exercise 6, but instead of declaring an array of three CandyBar
//structures, use new to allocate the array dynamically.

#include "stdafx.h"
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;


int main()
{
	int n, i;
	struct candybar {
		string brandname;
		float weight;
		int calories;
	};

	
	//candybar *p = new candybar;
	candybar *p = new candybar[3];//define the array to candybar,important


	for (n = 0; n < 3; n++)
	{
		cout << "=======Enter the information for candybar " << n + 1 << " =========" << endl;
		cout << "pls enter the barndname:";
		getline(cin, p[n].brandname);

		cout << "pls enter the weight:";
		cin >> p[n].weight;

		cout << "pls enter the calories:";
		cin >> p[n].calories;
		cin.get();//to extract the ' enter' char from the register which stored by 'cin' in last step,so that will not affect the next operation by 'getline'
	}
	cout << endl << endl;
	for (i = 0; i < 3;i++)
	{
		cout << " ********the candybar " << i + 1 << " you entered is: ******** " << endl;
		cout << "Brandname is " << p[i].brandname << endl;
		cout << "weight is " << p[i].weight << endl;
		cout << "calories is " << p[i].calories << endl;
	}
	return 0;

/ chapter5exercise8.cpp : Write a program that uses an array of char and a loop to read one word at a time
//until the word done is entered.The program should then report the number of
//words entered(not counting done).A sample run could look like this:
//Enter words(to stop, type the word done) :
	//anteater birthday category dumpster
	//envy finagle geometry done for sure
	//You entered a total of 7 words.
	//You should include the cstring header file and use the strcmp() function to
	//make the comparison test.

#include "stdafx.h"
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
//#include<cstring>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char ch[50];
	int count = 0;
	cout << "Enter words ( type word done to stop): " << endl;
	cin >> ch; //get a word

	while (strcmp(ch,"done")!=0)
	{
		++count; //count the word
		cin >> ch; //get the next word
	}

	cout << "you entered a total of " << count << " words." << endl;
    return 0;
}

// chapter5exercise1.cpp : Write a program that requests the user to enter two integers.The program should
//then calculate and report the sum of all the integers between and including the two
//integers.At this point, assume that the smaller integer is entered first.For example, if
//the user enters 2 and 9, the program should report that the sum of all the integers
//from 2 through 9 is 44.

#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	
	
	int x,y,sum;
	cout << "please enter 2 numbers in ascending order, press 'enter' to seperate each number" << endl;
	cin >> x;
	cin >> y;
	sum = x;
	while (x < y)
		x++,
		sum +=x;
	

	cout << "the sum of all integers between and including the above 2 numbers is:" << endl;

// chapter5exercise7.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
//Design a structure called car that holds the following information about an automobile:
//its make, as a string in a character array or in a string object, and the year
//it was built, as an integer.Write a program that asks the user how many cars to catalog.
//The program should then use new to create a dynamic array of that many car
//structures.Next, it should prompt the user to input the make(which might consist
	//of more than one word) and year information for each structure.Note that this
	//requires some care because it alternates reading strings with numeric data(see
		//Chapter 4).Finally, it should display the contents of each structure.A sample run
	//should look something like the following :
//How many cars do you wish to catalog ? 2
//Car #1:
//Please enter the make : Hudson Hornet
//Please enter the year made : 1952
//Car #2:
//Please enter the make : Kaiser
//Please enter the year made : 1951
//Here is your collection :
//1952 Hudson Hornet
//1951 Kaiser
